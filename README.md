# 🧠 Explainable AI for Brain Tumour Diagnosis Using EfficientNetB0 and Grad-CAM

## Overview

The **Explainable AI for Brain Tumour Diagnosis Using EfficientNetB0 and Grad-CAM** is a Deep Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) project designed to automatically detect brain tumours from MRI images. The system uses **EfficientNetB0** for accurate tumour classification and **Grad-CAM** to generate visual heatmaps that highlight tumour regions, making the model's predictions transparent and interpretable.

The project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing fast, accurate, and explainable brain tumour diagnosis. An interactive **Gradio-based web application** allows users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions along with tumour localization.
